title: Final thoughts

Hey all! The class is pretty much over so this is my final blog post. My teacher evaluation wasn't very good so I'll try to make this a bit better. :P

**What did I enjoy about this class?**

Well, first of all Python is super fun and satisfying to use. Waaaaaaaay better than any other language I worked with so I can totally get the hype at this point. I've used Python before, but it was strictly utilitarian and I had no idea about the intricacies of the language (e.g. comprehensions, decorators etc). Having super in depth lectures on programming fundamentals was cool. We also did stuff like SQL and XML which are quite handy. 

However, the biggest thing was probably the final project. As Prof. Downing said, we'd HATE it at first (as evidenced by my previous posts), but then grow to appreciate what we were doing. We were basically dropped into a work environment with no knowledge of the tools we were using and had to figure them out ourselves. Super frustrating and it took a long time, but now I feel a lot more confident inspecting documentation myself and working with a group to figure things out instead of just asking a teacher or something like I usually do. I had a really fun time setting up and administering the Digital Ocean server, and felt like I developed a skill that will actually come in handy in the future (unlike, say, writing assembly...) And I have to say, I'm kind of missing spending 4/5 hours a day working on the project. It was fun in its own awful way!

**What could have been done better?**

I'm still not sure I like the testing format. Because it's just writing implementations of functions and stuff, it only covers a very small minority of the class material. As difficult as the quizzes are sometimes, I think I'd prefer if the tests were a combination of quiz type questions and code implementations because then they'd be easier to study for. Additionally, there are a lot of readings and most of them aren't really relevant so I found myself frequently skimming through them, though maybe that's the point. 

Additionally, Canvas Discussions didn't seem to really engage the students in the class as much as Piazza. I'm not sure why, but Piazza is always flooded with questions while Canvas Discussions did not have a SINGLE post for the entirety of Project 5. There may have been like 4 or 5 posts about each project which is so weird compared to the flood of specific questions Piazza forums generally have. I did like Canvas quizzes a lot better than Top Hat though.

Anyway, that's all from me! Can't believe the class is already over.
