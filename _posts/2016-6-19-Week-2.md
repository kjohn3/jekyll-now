**What did I do this week?**

This week, I finished up the Collatz project and started Netflix. Collatz in SWE was a bit more difficult because the timing on Sphere seemed to be stricter this time around, so I had to implement more optimizations than I thought I had to. Still only took me about 5 hours, but that's quite a bit of time for a project I have done before. After that, my partner and I started on the Netflix project ASAP. I'd say we're pretty far into it, with an RMSE of exactly 1.00, .01 off from what we need.

**What's in my way?**

I'm feeling more comfortable with python now, but I still have lots to learn. Downings lectures and the project are helping with that, though. I'm also thinking pretty hard about more optimizations I can do on the Netflix project, since it's getting pretty tough. Thankfully, we can deal with the probe data in about 15 seconds, so we have a lot of breathing room.

**What will I do next week?**

Tomorrow, my partner and I are going to finish up the Netflix project. It would be really nice to have that down without having to worry about the Tuesday rush (especially since the labs tend to be fuller on Tuesday and that's kind of stressful). After that, I'm going to start studying for that test. The implementations we've done in class have been quite easy, but I know from OOP that I need to know them VERY well!

**What did I think of the class this week?**

I loved the lectures this week. I've always kind of felt weak on lambdas and closures, so an in-depth lecture about them was great, and we're going to get more on closures soon. Also, list comprehensions are just about the coolest thing ever and knowing about them really helps me feel more 'pythonic'. It's also always nice to look more at map and reduce, because I forgot about them from 314 lol.

**Pick of the week!**

[Once again, I found something on Reddit.](http://blog.christoffer.me/10-principles-i-try-and-follow-in-my-day-to-day-work-based-on-10-years-of-coding-experience/) This blog post is basically some general tips for writing good code, something I feel rather weak about. To my dismay, he talks about the importance of testable code (and by extension unit tests), which means I really should get more comfortable with that stuff. He also talks about the importance of assertions and other things that I sometimes feel are superfluous in the context of the class, but really do have importance in the real world.
